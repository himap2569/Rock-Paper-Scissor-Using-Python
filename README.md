# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Using-Python
An imitation of the popular Rock-Paper-Scissor game to play with the computer and have fun. The code is developed using if-else statements 
based on user inputs and computer random generation of numbers, using the random package based on which the necessary switch cases are 
developed as the rules of the game. 
Have Fun! :)
